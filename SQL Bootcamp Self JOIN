-- Self-Join 

-- A self-join is a query in whihc a table is joined to itself. 
-- Self-joins are usefuo for comparing values in a column of rows within the same table. 

-- The self join can be viewed as a join of two copies of the same table. 

-- The table is not actually copied, but SQL performs the command as though it were. 

-- There is no special keyword for a self join, its simply standard JOIN syntax with the table 
-- both part. However, when you usinh a self join it is necessary to use an alias for the table, 
-- otherwise the table bames would be ambiguous. 

-- Here is syntax: 

	-- SELECT tableA.col, tableB.col
	-- FROM table AS tableA
	-- JOIN table AS tableB ON
	-- tableA.some_col = tableB.other_col

-- The main things to focus on are these table names. We can see that tabke as tableA and join table
-- as tableB, which mean assigning 2 different aliases to the same table. This will perfrom self join. 

-- keep in mind that even though you see representation of TableA, TableB, just table, all of these
-- are actually reffering to the same table. We are just using the aliases in order to organize this.

-- When do we want to use self join in the realistic situation? 

	-- exmaple syntax: 
	
		-- SELECT emp.name, report name
		-- FROM employees AS emp
		-- JOIN employees AS report ON 
		-- emp.emp_id = report.poert_id
		
	-- Let's se DVD rental DVD. Find all the pairs of films that have the same length. 
	
	SELECT f1.title, f2.title, f1.length 
	FROM film AS f1
	INNER JOIN film AS f2 ON 
	f1.film_id != f2.film_id
	AND f1.length = f2.length;
