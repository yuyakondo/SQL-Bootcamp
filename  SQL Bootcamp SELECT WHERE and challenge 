-- In this lecture we will learn about WHERE clause -- 

--  Basic syntax example: 

--SELECT column name 1, column name 2
--FROM table name
--WHERE conditions;

-- Basic comparison operators: 

-- Equal (=) 
-- Greater than (>)
-- Less than (<) 
-- Greater than or equal to (>=)
-- Less than or equal to (<=)
-- Not Equal to (<>) or (!=)

-- Logical Operators  

-- AND = Both logic have to be true 
-- OR = Either one logic have to be true 
-- NOT = Any condition is not true 

	-- Let's Practice and use the customer data -- 

	SELECT * FROM customer;

	-- Who have first name Jared ? -- 

	SELECT * FROM customer
	WHERE first_name = 'Jared';

 -- Let's try at the film table and try to apply the combine condition and logcial operators --
 
 	SELECT * FROM film;
	
-- Find the rental rates that are higher than $4 -- 

	SELECT * FROM film
	WHERE rental_rate > 4;
	
-- Let'add more condition. Find out rental rate with more than $4 and have high replacement cost 
-- Greater than or equal to $19.99

	SELECT * FROM film 
	WHERE rental_rate > 4 AND replacement_cost >= 19.99; 

-- Let's add more condition. Same condition from the previous one but add rating R

	SELECT * FROM film 
	WHERE rental_rate > 4 AND replacement_cost >= 19.99 
	AND rating ='R';
	
-- You can also grab movie title with same condition -- 

	SELECT title FROM film
	WHERE rental_rate > 4 AND replacement_cost >= 19.99
	AND rating ='R';

-- If you want to know how about movie title with same condition with above, simply using COUNT -- 

	SELECT COUNT(title) FROM film
	WHERE rental_rate > 4 AND replacement_cost >= 19.99
	AND rating ='R';
	-- Result: 34 movies -- 
	
-- Let's using OR logical condition. This time we want rating R or PG13 

	SELECT title FROM film
	Where rental_rate > 4 AND replacement_cost >= 19.99 
	AND rating = 'R' OR rating = 'PG-13'; 
	
-- Now how many there are both for rating for R and PG-13 ? 

	SELECT COUNT(title) FROM film 
	WHERE rental_rate > 4 AND replacement_cost >= 19.99 
	AND rating = 'R' OR rating = 'PG-13';
	-- Result: 257 movies 
	
-- Let's try condition with not equal to 

	SELECT * FROM film 
	WHERE rating != 'R';
	
----------------------------------- Challenge Tasks -----------------------------------------------

-- We are now focus more on directly asking business related questions, to more realisitcally model
-- a typical tasks. 

-- Task 1: A customer forgot their wallet at our store! We need to track down their email to inform
-- them. What is the email for the customer with the name Nancy Thomas? 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Check customer info 

	SELECT * FROM customer; 
	
-- Get the email address for Nancy Thomas email address using condition 

	SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM customer
	WHERE first_name = 'Nancy' AND last_name = 'Thomas';
	-- Email address for Nancy Thomas is: nancy.thomas@sakilacustomer.org
	
-- Task 2: A customer wants to know what the movie "Outlaw Hanky" about. Could you give them the 
-- description for the movie 'Outlaw Hanky'? 

-- Check the film info 
	
	SELECT * FROM film;
	
-- Get the movie name and description 

	SELECT title, description FROM film
	WHERE title = 'Outlaw Hanky';
	
	--A Thoughtful Story of a Astronaut And a Composer who must Conquer a Dog in The Sahara Desert
	
-- Task 3: A customer is late on their movie return, and we've mailed them a letter to their address
-- at '259 Ipoh Drive'. We should also call them know. Can you get the phone number for the customer
-- who lives at '259 Ipoh Drive'? 

-- Get the address info 

	SELECT * FROM address;
	
-- type the condition that match to the 259 Ipoh Drive

	SELECT phone FROM address
	WHERE address = '259 Ipoh Drive';
	-- Phone number is 419009857119
